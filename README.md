## High Concept
Players experience a dream-like adventure to uncover mysteries of cosmic import locked within their unconscious minds.
Each dream may reveal secrets new or old, but every one comes with their own otherworldly dangers both small and large.

### Specifics
* Genre: Roguelike
* Theme: Dreamscape, Lovecraftian
* Style: 2D Side-scrolling, pixelized
* Length: Roughly 30 to 45 minutes for a full-size session
* Saves: Log-book recording things learned from successful dreams like monsters, story, items, etc. Only save/quit voluntarily before death allowes save loading
* Control: TBD, controller-centric or controller-friendly
* Levels: Procedurally pieced-together prefabs of different levels, placed decidedly linear apart with optional side corridors
* Progression: Presumably different procedural set-pieces unlockable only with successful completion of a full level with bosses
* Cast: Early stages of development will feature an unnamed player character that "thinks" through subtitles, against numerous non playable enemies and bosses
